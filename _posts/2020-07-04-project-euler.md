Project Euler is a challenging programming website that I heard of a few years ago, from one of my supervisors back in the university. 

I like maths, and I love programming, but I never found spare time in my university life to pursue things that I may truly enjoy. As I continued my studies and started working outside, the thought of going to this website slowly fades away.

One day during the lockdown, I came across [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) posted on FreeCodeCamp. That's when I thought, "Ah, maybe now is the chance to start pushing myself out of my comfort zone again!"

Starting from today, I will try to complete the first hundred Project Euler problems in order. For each question, I will try to share my thought process on this blog. 

I'll be honest - I am not exceptionally skilled in either maths or programming. I would probably make many blunders during this challenge, but there aren't much better ways to improve one's maths/coding skills (I think). I hope you all can get inspired by the posts too!
