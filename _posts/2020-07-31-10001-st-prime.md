## Problem
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

## Solution
Not a very challenging problem. I've solved it with a very simple and inefficient prime generator.

The prime generator goes through all odd numbers in ascending order. It checks if the numbers are prime by dividing them with previously-confirmed primes. There are a few places for optimization, but it is not very necessary for this problem.

{% highlight python %}
def primes():
    yield 2
    primes = [2]
    test_prime = 3

    while True:
        if is_prime(test_prime, primes):
            yield test_prime
            primes.append(test_prime)

        test_prime += 2

def is_prime(number, primes):
    for prime in primes:
        if number % prime == 0:
            return False
    return True
{% endhighlight %}
