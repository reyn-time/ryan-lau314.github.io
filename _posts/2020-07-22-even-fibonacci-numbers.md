## Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<p style="text-align: center;">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution
Not a very challenging question. As long as you know how to generate Fibonacci numbers and filter out the even ones, this problem should not be hard.

Here is what I've written to generate the numbers in Python:

{% highlight python %}
def fib():
    first = 0
    second = 1
    while True:
        yield first
        first, second = second, first + second
{% endhighlight %}

The last line is particularly magical. A programmer would usually need three lines to write that kind of logic (I think)!
